				It's never too late to start running. The main thing is that your health allows it. Basic physical training is very important. And it's not just about the lower extremities — you need to develop the whole body: muscles, heart, and lungs, pay attention to stretching, joints, and ligaments.</p>
				<p>Please note! In some diseases, running is contraindicated, in others, on the contrary, it is welcome. Consult a doctor before you start running.</p>
				If your main goal is health, it makes sense to stick to a reasonable framework, not to run too much, focusing on the regularity of training.</p>
